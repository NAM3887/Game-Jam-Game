# Game-Jam-Game----Aim-Runner
This is the c++ code I wrote for the game I entered in the UML Game Jam
The game jam was to complete a game in 72 hours with the topic of Stamina.

This game was built upon the first person template in Unreal Engine. This project was made mostly using C++, I tried to avoid using blueprints on the core gameplay mechanics. Blueprints were used for the UI elements.
